# Experience

## Languages

### SwiftUI
Most of my swift knowledge has come from the [Prisoner's Dilemma](https://github.com/AdrianColaianni/Prisoner-s-Dilemma) and [EPHS app](activeProjects.md).

### Python
I am familiarized with python, but I wouldn't say I "know" it. My main use has been for playing around with code and learning APIs and OAuth.

### Java
Java was the first language I really learned, and I used it for [Pillager Towers](pastProjects.md).

### HTML
I have not written much HTML, but I do have a good understanding of the basics. My most notable uses have been [Garage Prints Website](pastProjects.md) and [Troop 695 2020 Summer Plant Sale Fundraiser](pastProjects.md).

### Markdown (as evidenced)
Ever since I first used it, I have loved writing markdown due to it's simplicity in writing and rendering.

### C Languages
All of my C knowledge has come from working in Visual Studio 2019 and creating Windows apps.

### MIT App Inventor
I have written a multitude of apps in MIT App Inventor, my favorites being [Facebook Tap: Saga](pastProjects/FacebookTap_Saga.apk) and [Facebook Tap 2: Saga](pastProjects/FacebookTap2_Saga.apk). These were created for my AP Computer Science Principles class.

## IDEs

### Eclipse & IntelliJ IDEA
I worked with these IDEs for my Java class, and to make [Pillager Towers](pastProjects.md).

### Visual Studio 2019
I worked with this to write a few Windows apps. More in C languages section.

### VS Code (what I wrote this in)
By far my favorite editor.

### MS Azure
Used this for [Garage Prints Website](pastProjects.md) and in part for [Troop 695 2020 Summer Plant Sale Fundraiser](pastProjects.md).
