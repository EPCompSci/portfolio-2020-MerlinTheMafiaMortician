## Pillager Towers

This was undertaken as a final project for AP Java, in which [Aidan](https://github.com/kelvinnkat) and I created a Forge Minecraft mod in which abandon structures were randomly generated in the world.

This project proved difficult as we had to take out limited syntax knowledge and expand it to true coding capabilities without guidance.

## Garage Prints Website

This was a flirtation with the idea of using my formerly functional 3D printer to print on demand. While it never became the business I envisioned, I learned a lot about using MS Azure for web hosing and writing html.

## Troop 695 2020 Summer Plant Sale Fundraiser

During summer 2020, our boy scout troop needed a contact-less method for selling plants for our annual fundraiser. I worked in collaboration with [Roger Hipwell](mailto:roger.hipwell@gmail.com), a web developer, to build a site where customers could order plants. Unfortunately, the site is no longer up and won't be reused. Although, it taught me practical design and collaboration.
