## EPHS App

This is the most interesting of what I'm up to. I have partnered with 5 fellow geniuses, [Connor](https://github.com/connorholm), [Jose](mailto:josemartinblancodiaz22@gmail.com), [Jack](https://github.com/jackgsch), [Rachel](https://github.com/rachelPark1), and [Parker](https://github.com/ParkerJ30), to construct an app for our fellow students to easily access homework and class information.

I have pushed 30% of all commits, despite being on a team of 6. This is 76% higher than average.
