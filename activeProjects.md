## [EPHS App](https://epcompsci.github.io/ephs/index.html)

[In the App Store now!](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ephs/id1540598932)

This is the most interesting of what I'm up to. I have partnered with 5 fellow geniuses, [Connor](https://github.com/connorholm), [Jose](mailto:josemartinblancodiaz22@gmail.com), [Jack](https://github.com/jackgsch), [Rachel](https://github.com/rachelPark1), and [Parker](https://github.com/ParkerJ30), to construct an app for our fellow students to easily access homework and class information.

Although we've been working on it for the past 21 weeks, we have a lot more planned for the app and some of us have chosen to continue it's development. The app is in the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ephs/id1540598932) and we'll continue to push updates for it.

As far as my contributions to the app, I have been working on the back-end API access for retrieving student and teacher information from our school's current system. Additionally, I've been managing git and fixing errors.

I have pushed 35% of all commits, despite being on a team of 6. That's 204% above what would be expected of me.
